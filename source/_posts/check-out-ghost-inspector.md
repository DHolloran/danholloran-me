I saw this cool tool the other day on Twitter [Ghost Inspector ](https://ghostinspector.com) which allows your to record your actions or setup by drag/drop website regression testing. I've done some work with [Nightwatch.js](http://nightwatchjs.org) which helps writing tests for [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org) which allows you test across all the major browsers.

Honestly writing regression tests can be kind of difficult. As well as short of watching the tests pass not too much fun. That's why I think [Ghost Inspector ](https://ghostinspector.com) is worth a look. Might make it easier for small teams to do more wide scale regression testing on their sites. They seem to have a wide range of [tools you can integrate](https://ghostinspector.com/docs/integration/) with so hopefully getting started will be quick and easy. Check out [Ghost Inspector ](https://ghostinspector.com)  today.
